EasyG started out as a script that I use to automate some information gathering tasks for my hacking process, [click here to discover what it does](tools/#easyg). Now it's more than that. Here I gather all the resources about hacking that I find interesting: notes, payloads, tools and more.

I try as much as possible to link to the various sources or inspiration for these notes. A large part of these notes are from: [PTS v4](https://blog.elearnsecurity.com/introducing-the-ptsv4-training-course.html), [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), [PEN-200](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/), [Proving Grounds](https://www.offsec.com/labs/individual/), ["Attacking and Defending Active Directory Lab (CRTP)" by Altered Security](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab), [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC) and [Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com/), [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), [Jhaddix](https://twitter.com/Jhaddix), [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.thecybermentor.com/), [Mantas Sabeckis](https://ott3rly.com/), [NahamSec](https://www.youtube.com/@NahamSec) (and [NahamCon](https://www.nahamcon.com/)), InfoSec Twitter and many other amazing people.
